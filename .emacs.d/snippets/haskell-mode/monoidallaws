-- Naturality (here: g *** h == \(x,y) -> (g x, h y))
-- fmap (g *** h) (u ** v) = fmap g u ** fmap h v

-- Left Identity
-- unit ** v ≅ v
-- In this and the following laws, ≅ refers to isomorphism rather than equality. In particular we consider (x,()) ≅ x ≅ ((),x) and ((x,y),z) ≅ (x,(y,z)).

-- Right Identity
-- u ** unit ≅ u

-- Associativity
-- u ** (v ** w) ≅ (u ** v) ** w

-- All of the above laws are equivalent to the applicative laws
-- Identity, Homomorphism, Interchangeability, Composition
