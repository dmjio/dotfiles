There's a fine distinction between concurrency and parallelism:
# parallelism is all about making your program run faster by making
# use of multiple processors simultaneously. Concurrency, on the other
# hand, is a means of abstraction: it is a convenient way to structure
# a program that must respond to multiple asynchronous events.
