union Arg {
  struct Val *boxed;     /* most values are boxed */
  unsigned long unboxed; /* "primitive" values */
};

typedef struct Val {
  const struct ValInfo *info;
  union Arg *args[];  /* args can be boxed or unboxed */
} Val;

Unboxed types have no constructor and cannot be thunks
Can fit in a single register or take the place of a Val * arg
Must extend GCInfo to identify which args are and are not boxed
