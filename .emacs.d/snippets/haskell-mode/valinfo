typedef struct Val {
  const struct ValInfo *info;
  struct Val *args[];
} Val;

struct ValInfo {
  struct GCInfo gcInfo;  /* for garbage collector */
  enum { THUNK, CONSTRNO, FUNC, IND } tag;
  union {
    Exception *(*thunk) (Val *closure);
    unsigned int constrno;
    Val *(*func) (const Val *closure, const Val *arg);
  };
};

gcInfo says how many Val *s are in args and where they are

tag == CONSTRNO means constrno valid, used as on last slide

tag == IND means args[0] is an indirect forwarding pointer to another

Val and union is unused; useful if size of args grows
